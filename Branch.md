##Explain what a branch is

Each branch is a different version of the project. This may be chronological iterations of the project (i.e. Verion 1, Verion 2) or parallel versions of the 'master' version containing experimental features in development or testing.

###Using branches

To create new branch you use:

````
$ git branch new_branch_name
````

To switch to an exisiting branch you use:

````
$ git checkout branch_name
````
